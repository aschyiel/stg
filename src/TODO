Pew needs a forward acceleration.
player needs acceleration instead of linear movement.  
Pew needs to be abstracted to a "projectile" class of type "linear forward", 
    implying you can have "curved" projectiles such as side-winder missles.
Background needs to be less boring, perhaps create simple engine to animate viruses/snowFlakes.  
Background needs to "move", to give the impression the player is moving "farther" left/right.
need destructables.
need collision
need enemies.
need different weapon types.

need to "save" scores.

rsrc manager (hashmap to files, etc...)
need sound effects.
